### Installation

TypeSense will soon be published in the Chrome Web Store. Stay tuned!

<!--Once installed, TypeSense requires no further setup. Just open a conversation and click the TypeSense icon to visualize its sentiment.-->

## Why?

Conversations can be ambiguous. They're even more ambiguous online, where the body language and intonation cues that usually help us interpret meaning are lost. People without neurological disorders misunderstand each other all the time – sarcasm makes it hard to know for sure what someone means, and idioms are confusing! _Imagine how hard it must be for people with social disabilities._

TypeSense makes it a little easier for those with developmental disorders, like autism, to understand the emotions of others when chatting online.

## Features

* Visualize the conversation's sentiment over time
* See how each message impacted the overall sentiment

__Pending Features:__

* Analyze/visualize the social tones of who you're talking to (openness, conscientiousness, extraversion, agreeableness, and emotional range)
* Predict the impact of messages on the conversation's sentiment before sending them
